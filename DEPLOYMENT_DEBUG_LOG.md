# AirPower USA V3 - Deployment Troubleshooting Log

## Current Status
- ✅ **Local dev server working perfectly** at `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ **All requested edits completed successfully**
- ❌ **Netlify deployment serving raw HTML without CSS styling**

## What We've Tried (All Failed)
1. **Netlify Configuration Fixes**
   - Removed `publish = ".next"` from netlify.toml (conflicted with @netlify/plugin-nextjs)
   - Updated Node.js version from 18 → 22 to match local environment
   - Tried "Retry without cache" multiple times

2. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Converted next.config.ts → next.config.js (CommonJS)
   - Commented out `output: 'standalone'` (incompatible with Netlify plugin)

3. **Tailwind CSS Troubleshooting**
   - Initially attempted to downgrade Tailwind v4 → v3 (caused more issues)
   - Fixed local dev server by correcting `@theme inline {}` → `@theme {}` in globals.css
   - Kept Tailwind v4 setup as it was working before

4. **Build & Cache Clearing**
   - Cleared local `.next` build cache multiple times
   - Used Netlify's "Retry without cache" option
   - Created entirely new GitHub repository and Netlify project

## The Core Problem
- **Netlify consistently deploys raw HTML without CSS**
- **Same exact code works perfectly locally**
- **This suggests Netlify + Tailwind v4 + Next.js 15 incompatibility**

## Completed Edits (All Working Locally)
1. ✅ Reordered Newsroom page sections (Hero → Press → Media → Videos → CTA)
2. ✅ Added "Video Gallery" title to video section
3. ✅ Updated SEC Filings: $5K → $10K minimum investment
4. ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in UseCases.tsx
5. ✅ Fixed local Tailwind v4 theme syntax

## Technical Details
- **Local Environment**: Node.js v22.17.0, Next.js 15.3.4, Tailwind v4.1.12
- **Repository**: https://github.com/brycemalcom/airpowerusaV3
- **Broken Netlify URL**: https://airpowerusav3.netlify.app/
- **Issue**: Raw HTML renders, no CSS/styling, navigation broken

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Try Vercel** (Next.js creators, better Tailwind v4 support)
2. **Try Railway or Render** as alternatives
3. **Last resort**: Downgrade to Tailwind v3 just for deployment

## Files Modified This Session
- `src/app/newsroom/page.tsx` - Reordered sections
- `src/components/sections/NewsSection.tsx` - Removed CTA box
- `src/components/sections/VideoGallery.tsx` - Added title
- `src/app/filings/page.tsx` - Updated investment amounts
- `src/components/sections/UseCases.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript error
- `src/app/globals.css` - Fixed Tailwind v4 theme syntax
- `netlify.toml` - Removed publish directory, updated Node.js version
- `next.config.js` - Converted from TypeScript, removed standalone output

## Key Insight
**The code is 100% correct** - local dev server proves this. The issue is purely with Netlify's build/deployment environment not properly handling our Tailwind v4 + Next.js 15 setup.
